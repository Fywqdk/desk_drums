# Circuitpython port

Initial python files created. Still some work to be done.

Todo:
- Test full analog drum setup
  - Waiting for 3D printer and desk mats in mail
- Create schematic for electronics
  - Current build relies on 2x ADS1115 16bit 4-channel ADC which are querried over I2C for input
- Test Pedal class
  - Haven't had time, a Pedal is printed though.
- Complete the full build and post pictures.
